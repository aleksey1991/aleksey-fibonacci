Bug report

Fibonacci Backend:
Fibonacci Backend service performed as expected. All the tests passed with valid behavior.
All the results of the tests can be viewed in the results.log

Large fibonacci number test (input= 99999999) failed. It froze the backend code. For this reason this test is commented out in the test code.



Fibonacci Frontend
This service was not tested for time constraints + this service doesnt seem to be working at all after a few manual tries.
However in order to test this service Selenium would be used to test the webpage.

1) Content will be tested to make sure proper text is present
2) happy path input will be tested to make sure we get correct results displayed
3) all the negative tests from the backend service should be re-run again to make sure user gets a proper error message
